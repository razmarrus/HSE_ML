# Course: Introduction to Machine learning by HSE (Введение в машинное обучение)

Jupyter notebooks which may be found in this repo was part of ***[Introduction to Machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/vvedenie-mashinnoe-obuchenie?)*** *coursera* course by HSE (Higher School of Economics) University & Yandex School of Data Analysis.


I did not publish any data from the course itself except tasks conditions that are needed as a code context.

## About


This course is nothing like legendary Andrew Ng's course in a way that Assignments are designed. You note just implement few lines of code, you're actually write everything. You may see most of the tasks as they were given to students (without theory, of course) in assignments itselves


All code was written from scratch, except little hints like about import and model's parameters (this will be indicated in the task).

## Topics covered in assigments (by weeks)

1. Pandas basics, decision trees
2. k-nearest neighbor algorithm, metric-tuning, feacha normalization 
3. SVM, logistic regression, Metrics of model performance quality
4. Linear regression, Ridge regression
5. Random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks
